/**
 * What Instagram's embed page tells the page around it. It posts a few messages to its parent:
 * `LOADING` as it starts, then `MEASURE` with the height its content needs and `MOUNTED` once the
 * post is on screen. A page that cannot show the post -- one that says the link may be broken --
 * sends the first and never the others, which is how a card tells a post that did not load from one
 * that is still loading.
